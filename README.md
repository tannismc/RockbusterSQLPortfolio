Portfolio of SQL data analysis project

This project is an SQL analysis of a sample dataset for a fictional movie rental company looking to launch an online video rental service using their existing video library.

The analysis was done using PostgreSQL and the report figures were created in Tableau. The data dictionary includes an ERD created in Lucidchart.

The main questions answered in this analysis were:
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
3. Where are custmoers with a high lifetime value based?
4. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
